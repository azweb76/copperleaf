# Copper Leaf Job Phase Management Prototype

This repository contains a working prototype for a semester long project for an Object Oriented Analysis and Design course I took at Scottsdale Community college. The goal of the project was to analyze and design a system change for a company we chose. We chose to enhance the Job Phase management processes for Copper Leaf Pools by developing a new online system for tracking jobs, phases, clients, and vendors. The project had three deliverables: project proposal, system proposal, and system specification.
